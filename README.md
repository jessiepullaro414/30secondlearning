# 30 Second Learning

30 second learning is a social media platform that uses condensed educational content to target the shortened attention span of the younger generations to optimize learning. 

### Prerequisites

This is a changing list but at the moment you will need:

```
Node.js
Expressjs
Pug
body-parser
```

### Installing

I am new to the JS world but to install everything just change into the right directory and type in:

```
npm install
```

That will install what you need.
